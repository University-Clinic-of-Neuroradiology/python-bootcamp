# Note to participants of our Bootcamp

There is no need to follow any installation process if you are using Google Colab. Instructions below are for setting it up yourself.

## Installation instructions

The exercises use [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).
These provide a nice GUI interface to Python. You need to do a few steps:

### Installing Jupyter/Python on your Laptop
 
For regular off-line use you should consider installing a Jupyter Notebook/Python environment directly on your laptop. This will provide you with reliable off-line access to a computational environment. This will also allow you to install additional code libraries to meet particular needs. 
 
Choosing this option will require an initial software installation and routine updates. For this course the recommended package is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Downloading and installing the software is well documented and easy to follow. Allow about 10-30 minutes for the installation depending on your connection speed. 
 
After installing be sure to check for updates before proceeding further. With the Anaconda package this is done by executing the following two commands in a terminal window:
```Shell
conda update conda
conda update anaconda
```
