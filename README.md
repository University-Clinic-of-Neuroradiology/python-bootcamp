# Python Bootcamp

A Python bootcamp for medical students designed to teach basic DICOM and imaging data handling skills.

## Links to documentation
Full instructions on getting started are in our [documentation for participants](DocForParticipants.md).
Despite the name, this documentation is also appropriate if you are trying these exercises on your own.

Installation instructions when you do not use Google Colab are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), but read the above links first.

## Support
We are always open to suggestions and comments. Likewise, we welcome the reporting of possible bugs. Please always write a short but descriptive issue. We will then try to implement everything as quickly as possible.

## Roadmap
In a galaxy far, far away....
