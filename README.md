## Links to documentation
Full instructions on getting started are in our [documentation for participants](DocForParticipants.md).
Despite the name, this documentation is also appropriate if you are trying these exercises on your own.

Installation instructions when you do not use Google Colab are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), but read the above links first.

## Support
We have prepared a Wiki/FAQ for you, which should help you to solve any problems that may arise without further ado. 

We are always open to suggestions and comments. Likewise, we welcome the reporting of possible bugs. Please always write a short but descriptive issue, use the prefabricated templates for this. We will then try to implement everything as quickly as possible.

If you have any questions, problems or comments, regarding the content of the notebooks please send us an email at any time: xyz@ovgu.de.

We have a discussion forum where you can exchange ideas or get in touch with us at any time!
