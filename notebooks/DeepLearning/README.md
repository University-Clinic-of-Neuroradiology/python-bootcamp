# Contents

This directory contains a few basic notebooks to expand your deep learning knowledge. Working with Keras and TensorFlow, youâ€™ll learn about neural networks, the deep learning model workflows, and how to optimize your models.

In this skill track, you'll work with different Open-Source datasets:
- [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) [1,2]


## Learning objectives

By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:
- to use Keras to train and test models
- ...
