# Contents

This directory contains a few basic notebooks to learn exploring, manipulating and measuring biomedical image data. You can also have a look on the corresponding [slides](https://raw.githack.com/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/main/notebooks/ImageAnalysis/slides/ImageAnalysis.slides.html#/).

In this skill track, you'll work with different Open-Source datasets:
- CT scan from [The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/about-the-cancer-imaging-archive-tcia/)
- Hand radiograph from a 2017 [Radiological Society of North America competition](https://www.rsna.org/rsnai/ai-image-challenge/rsna-pediatric-bone-age-challenge-2017)
- MR imaging data from the [Sunnybrook Cardiac Dataset](https://www.cardiacatlas.org/sunnybrook-cardiac-data/) [1]
- MRI DICOM data set [head of a normal male human](https://zenodo.org/record/16956#.YFMM5PtKiV5) [2] and 
- Open Access Series of Imaging Studies [Oasis](https://www.oasis-brains.org/) [3]

## Basic concepts of Exploration <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/main/notebooks/ImageAnalysis/01_exploration.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
The [exploration](01_exploration.ipynb) notebook serves as a starting point for all following notebooks. 
To begin the course, you'll learn how to load, build and navigate N-dimensional images using a CT image of the human brain.

## Basic concepts of Image Comparison <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/main/notebooks/ImageAnalysis/02_image_comparison.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
[image\_comparison](02_image_comparison.ipynb) discusses basics of registration, resampling, and image comparison.
You'll learn the basics of registration, resampling, and image comparison. Then, you'll use the extracted measurements to evaluate the effect of Alzheimer's Disease on brain structure.

## Basic concepts of Masks and Filters <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/main/notebooks/ImageAnalysis/03_masks_and_filters.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
[masks\_and\_filters](03_masks_and_filters.ipynb) is a notebook that cut image processing to the bone by transforming CT images.
You'll learn how to exploit intensity patterns to select sub-regions of an array, and you'll use convolutional filters to detect interesting features.

## Basic concepts of Measurements <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/main/notebooks/ImageAnalysis/04_measurements.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
[measurements](04_measurements.ipynb) is a notebook about image segmentation, object labeling, and morphological measurement.
You'll learn the fundamentals of image segmentation, object labeling, and morphological measurement.


## Learning objectives

By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:
- Competence in exploring, manipulating, and analyzing biomedical image data using Python and relevant libraries.
- Proficiency in image processing techniques including segmentation, filtering, and measurement applicable in biomedical contexts.
- Understanding of how to assess and compare biomedical images for various purposes, including disease evaluation and structural analysis.
