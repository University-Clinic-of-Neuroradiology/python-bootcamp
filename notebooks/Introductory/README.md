This directory contains a few basic notebooks to get you going. It is recommended to start with these
before tackling any of the others. You can also download the corresponding [slides](../Introductory/slides/Bootcamp_Python_Introduction.pdf).


## Basic concepts of Python and Jupyter Notebooks <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/develop/notebooks/DICOM/01.01-Getting-Started-with-Python-and-Jupyter-Notebooks.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
The [Getting Started with Python and Jupyter Notebooks](01.01-Getting-Started-with-Python-and-Jupyter-Notebooks.ipynb) notebook serves as a starting point for all following notebooks. The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to get you started using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. This introduction assumes this is your first exposure to Python or Jupyter notebooks.

## Basic concepts of Python Conditionals and Libraries <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/develop/notebooks/DICOM/01.02-Python-Conditionals-and-Libraries.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
The purpose of the [Python Conditionals and Libraries](01.02-Python-Conditionals-and-Libraries.ipynb) notebook is to get you started using control structures.

## Basic concepts of Python Error Handling <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-Clinic-of-Neuroradiology/python-bootcamp/blob/develop/notebooks/DICOM/01.03-Python-Error-Handling.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
The purpose of the [Python Error Handling](01.03-Python-Error-Handling.ipynb) notebook is to handle exceptions and create useful error messages.
 

## Learning objectives
By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:
- Get a feel for Jupyter notebooks and the basic python variables and functions.
- You can read and write basic Python code.
- Read and use error output from exceptions.
