Resembling a table or spreadsheet, it consists of rows and columns, where each column can hold different data types (numeric, string, boolean, etc.). The DataFrame provides powerful tools for data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and exploration. It allows for easy indexing, slicing, merging, reshaping, and aggregating data, making it a versatile and fundamental tool in data science and analysis workflows."
